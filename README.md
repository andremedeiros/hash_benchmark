# Benchmarking MRIâ€™s hash implementation

The point of this experiment is to benchmark MRI's hash table implementation vs others to see if it can be improved upon.

Right now there are three contenders:

- st (not the modified one bundled with Ruby, as I wasn't able to get it to work yet.)
- uthash (can be found [here](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash))
- tommy hash (can be found [here](http://tommyds.sourceforge.net))

Code is compiled with `-O3` and binds to `jemalloc`

## Results

__This is very incomplete, more to come.__

All these tests are run with:
- 2 runs
- 100,000 iterations each
- 100 different keys on each iteration

Results are ordered from fastest to slowest.
