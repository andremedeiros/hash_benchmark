# Benchmarking MRIâ€™s hash implementation

The point of this experiment is to benchmark MRI's hash table implementation vs others to see if it can be improved upon.

Right now there are two contenders:

- st (which is bundled with Ruby itself, and slightly modified)
- uthash (can be found [here](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash))

## Results

__This is very incomplete, more to come.__
