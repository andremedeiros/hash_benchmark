# Benchmarking MRIâ€™s hash implementation

The point of this experiment is to benchmark MRI's hash table implementation vs others to see if it can be improved upon.

Right now there are two contenders:

- st (not the modified one bundled with Ruby, as I wasn't able to get it to work yet.)
- uthash (can be found [here](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash))

Code is compiled with `-O3` and binds to `jemalloc`

## Results

__This is very incomplete, more to come.__

All these tests are run with:
- 2 runs
- 100,000 iterations each
- 100 different keys on each iteration

### Writes

```
st:     64079.36 i/sec  (3.121130 seconds)
uthash: 128423.94 i/sec (1.557342 seconds)
```

### Reads

```
st:     362623.60 i/sec (0.551536 seconds)
uthash: 275530.29 i/sec (0.725873 seconds)
```

### Non-existant key reads

```
st:    391402.46 i/sec (0.510983 seconds)
uthash 352387.45 i/sec (0.567557 seconds)
```
